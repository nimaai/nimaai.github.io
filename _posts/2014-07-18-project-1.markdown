description: When it comes to working with an offshore team, there will always be challenges, but these can be resolved through open communication, understanding, and working together toward a common goal. Outsourcing should not be a burden but rather help alleviate problems and tasks that you cannot do alone. In the past years I could actively contribute to and stear towards a successful off- and nearshoring partnerships that resulted in robust, correct and cost-effective solutions.
