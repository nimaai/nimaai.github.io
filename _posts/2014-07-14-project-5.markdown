description: Software as a service (SaaS) is the most commonly used option for businesses in the cloud market. The reason? It’s easily accessible – all you need is an internet connection and a browser – and it’s hands-off. The SaaS delivery model requires vendors to manage all the technical issues – meaning customers don’t need to lean on their in-house IT expertise. As a founding member of Functional GmbH in Switzerland I have gained sufficient insight as well as expertise in all the different aspects of SaaS solutions and customer relationships.
