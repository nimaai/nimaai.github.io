description: Test management is a process of managing testing activities, such as planning, execution, monitoring, and controlling activities. Test management involves several crucial activities that caters to both manual and automation testing. With the assistance of this process, a team lead can easily manage the entire testing team, while monitoring their activities, as well as paying close attention to various details of software development life cycle. I offer a certificate as well as a rich experience in all aspects of software testing.
